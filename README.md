# Monolithic & Microservices Architecture 

## What is Monolothic Architecture?

  * Single jar/war file for whole application
  * Issues
     *  Less flexible for large team and code base
     *  Overload IDE
     *  Continuous development is difficult
     *  Scaling the app is difficult
     *  Scaling development is difficult
     *  Technology stack change is difficult

## What is Microservice Architecture?

   => A Set of loosely coupled, collaborating services. Each service is relating several parameters:
  * Highly maintainable and testable
  * Loosely coupled with other services
  * Independently deployable
  * Capable of being developed by a small team
  * Services can be developed independent of each other
  * Communication among service via HTTP/REST/AMQP
  * Service granularity (how small service and how to size of the service capacity. Logically)
  * Linguistic approach
  * Technologic agnostic
  More about Microservices:
      * Microservices is a specialization of an implementation approarch for service - oriented architecure (SOA) used to build flexible, independently deployable software systems.
      * Followed the introduction of DevOps
      * Strategy - "Do one thing and do it well".
